Citero-ruby
==========
Ruby repository for the [Citero](https://github.com/NYULibraries/citero) project.

Citero is a program that allows for mapping of data inputs from various systems into one normalized metadata schema
tentatively known as *Citero Standard Form*, or *CSF*. From the normalized schema, *CSF*, it can produce another output
format for use by another system.

Citero-ruby is a complete rewrite of the Java project in Ruby.
